        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and
          population. Its 3.7 million inhabitants make it the European Union's
          most populous city, according to population within city limits. Berlin
          straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a
          tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. The city
          lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a
          variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects.

        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
          First documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two
          important historic trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the
          Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), Kingdom of Prussia
          (1701–1918), German Empire (1871–1918), Weimar Republic (1919–1933),
          and Nazi Germany (1933–1945). Berlin has served as a scientific,
          artistic and philosophical hub of the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism,
          and liberal revolution. The Gründerzeit era's
          industrialization-induced economic boom multiplied Berlin's population
          rapidly. Berlin in the roaring 1920s was the third-largest city in the
          world by population.
